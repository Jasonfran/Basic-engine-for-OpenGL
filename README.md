# Basic-engine-for-OpenGL
Basic engine to help me learn OpenGL. No pro but learning as I go. Will hopefully expand it's functionality in the future.

#Things to add
* Finish image loader to ease loading textures
* Model loader using assimp. 
* Add event system for easier keyboard, mouse and "game" event handling
* Build basic GUI functionality, probably [NanoVG](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg) but could try making my own basic buttons and sliders
* Basic forward rendering to begin with, will improve graphics effects as I continue
