# Basic-engine-for-OpenGL
Basic engine to help me learn OpenGL. No pro but learning as I go. Will hopefully expand it's functionality in the future.

I used http://learnopengl.com/ to learn OpenGL and to help myself implement the basics of the engine such as shader loading, texture loading and model loading.

## Result so far

This scene uses a free model from http://graphics.cs.williams.edu/data/meshes.xml but in obj format and does not textures. Has point light with shadows.

## External libraries
* GLFW
* GLM
* Assimp
* STB Image
